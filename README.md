# VANET Certificate Generation and Authentication System

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a computationally efficient Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET) certificate generation and authentication system for vehicles within the VANET. The system ensures that only verified and authenticated vehicles are allowed into the network, and it facilitates efficient and protected communication between the vehicles.

## Project Objectives

1. **Efficient Certificate Generation and Authentication:** Design a computationally efficient VANET certificate generation and authentication system for vehicles, ensuring that only verified and authenticated vehicles are allowed into the network.

2. **Protected Communication:** Ensure efficient and protected communication between the vehicles within the VANET.

3. **Trusted Authority Verification:** Only the Trusted Authority within the VANET should be able to verify the vehicles.

## Usage

To use the system, follow these steps:

1. Run the Python script provided in the repository.
2. Enter a prime number when prompted, or type 'exit' to end the process.
3. The system will perform VANET certificate generation and authentication.
4. User and RSU authentication results will be displayed.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Modules -> random, math, sys, easygui, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, time, mpmath

Install the required dependencies

## Code Structure

Main Script: The main script for VANET certificate generation and authentication is main_script.py.
Helper Functions: Helper functions for prime number checking, primitive root finding, and other calculations are defined in separate files.
Results
The system outputs the results of user and RSU authentication, providing details such as Lambda values, challengers, and authentication success/failure messages.
